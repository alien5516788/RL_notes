#   MDP only give the environment structure, not solution.

# Bellman Equation
#   Bellman equation define the fundamental learning flow using MDP
#
#     V_π(s) <- Eπ[R_t+1 + γV_π(S_t+1) | S_t = s]
#
#   This can be defined as recusive if it's calculated repeatedly on next state
#   But most of the time V(s') the existing entry of a table or an nn
#   The equation has variations based on the algorithm, but the basic structure is same
